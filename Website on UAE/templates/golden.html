      <p>Islam spreads across the region, laying the foundation of cultural and spiritual life. In the 7th century, Islam spread to the region now known as the UAE through the efforts of Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs envoys and the early Muslim Caliphate. Many local tribes, such as the Bani Yas and Al Azd, accepted Islam during or shortly after the Prophet's lifetime. After his death in 632 CE, some tribes rebelled, leading to the Battle of Dibba‚Äîa key event where Muslim forces defeated the opposition and solidified Islamic rule in the area. By the mid-7th century, the UAE was part of the Islamic Caliphate, with Islamic beliefs, laws, and culture firmly established through trade, tribal alliances, and military campaigns.</p>

It marked the beginning of a series of agreements that led to the region being known as the Trucial States, securing British protection and bringing long-term peace and stability to the vital trading coast.</p>
